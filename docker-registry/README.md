# Docker Registry
The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. The Registry is open-source, under the permissive [Apache license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License)

[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. It is the worldâ€™s largest repository of container images with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers.

Users get access to free public repositories for storing and sharing images or can choose a subscription plan for private repositories.
